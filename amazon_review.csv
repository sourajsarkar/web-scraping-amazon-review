0,Amazon Customer,  This one's a classic. Styles may come and go this Vintage Casio will always have its own ardent followers. I am love understated but high on performance watches and  this fits the bill. I received prompt delivery by seller Crystalarc Lifestyle and the piece was packed properly. In fact I got one from a relatively new manufactured batch.

4,Khushal,"  Value for  money , almost indestructible. Great battery life of more than 7 years.I bought this at a price point of 1280 bucks.This is an icon watch from Casio. Few people will hate it , few will love it .I wanted this watch only for its simplicity and retro looks! Which is the only selling point of this watch!If you are more into wifi , nfc , bigger display , then  you are judging a wrong watch!Check it, Uploaded few snapshots on how it looks.I absolutely loved this watch again for looks , feels something from 1990â€™s. Its cheap , reliable , and invincible only till you drop it or scratch it.Features are as basic as its stripped down version Casio F91W , black colour polymer body and strap."
5,Amazon Customer,"  watch dial is too small. when i opened the box , i became confused if this watch is for kids or womens.( may be i am used to with bigger dials.)  otherwise its a good product.  but in my openion price is little high."

9,Aditya,"  Wanted to buy this since long. Got good pricing listed so bought immediately. Although it's quite affordable so no issues with that. Excellent quality. Vintage classic, never gets out of style, thing you should have in your wardrobe, goes with almost every type of apparel. What else so you need.The most popular and reliable watch overall. Obama to Osama, everyone's choice. Pictures attached ( please bear with my bear like hand)"
10,Aditya,"  The piercing beeps of the alarm wake you from your reverie. You are standing behind the counter at the record store and the alarm means that your shift is over. You look down at the sleek clean lines of the high tech silver watch by Casio and it truly is five PM, quitting time. You shuffle a pile of Madonna and Tears for Fears albums out of the way, and grab up some junk to bring to the stock room. Cleaning up, you spill water on the watch, no matter, just a wipe with the towel and good as new. You check the time in the dim room using the handy backlight, not really the best but works in the dark, the darker the better. You are meeting everyone down at the arcade and don't want to be late.Lately you have been using the stopwatch to time games on Pac-Man with the gang. You love being part of the future as Lionel Ritchie serenades you out of the store....."
11,Donnie Darko,"  I buy a lot of goods from Amazon, including Casio watches.The product I received is a fake. The product is flimsy (I know this is a relatively inexpensive watch), however, it is cheap even by Casio standards. As far as I am aware, all Casio timepieces are sold with at least a box or sleeve - such as a velvet pouch. This product was in a flimsy plastic bag with no branding. The cardboard you can see in the photos is as crap as it really appears.I wanted this watch as a complement to my collection of G-Shocks and other Casio watches, but this is going straight back to Amazon for a refund. For the record, after an extensive search I cannot find a page on Amazon to report counterfeit goods so hopefully, this review will serve as a warning to potential buyers not to buy this watch.Save your money and get an authentic model!"
12,Donnie Darko,"  Everything people say about this watch is correct. It's cheap, it's light, has dim illumination, has a plastic case, looks like a kids watch, scratches easily. Etc etc.Someone posted that these are counterfeit. I can't believe somebody would take the effort to counterfeit a $20 watch. That's like making a counterfeit penny. I could be wrong though.But damn I love this watch. It's brings me back to a simpler time (which is what you'd expect an analog watch to do).I kinda respect the people that I run into that wear these watches. They seem more down to earth than the boy wonder that sports the Rolex.If you're hesitating. Don't. Just buy it and enjoy it."
13,Manoj Kumar,"  I always wanted one as a kid back in the 80s, I thought the mix of digital and metal strap was cool. This updated version is fine. As others have mentioned the strap is pretty lightweight, but I actually quite like that. I have a Roamer Searock watch that weighs a ton, you never stop noticing that you're wearing a lump of metal of your wrist, by comparison the lightness of this watch is a bonus. Once it's on you hardly notice it at all, and the body is very slim line too so does get in the way when wearing long-sleeve shirts. Has the same functionality as a basic resin F-91W so I knew what to expect. I'd prefer if the light was better, but I guess they were alway pretty poor compared to the newer illuminator-style Casio watches. The wrist adjuster was very easy to move (I thought originally I ould have to have links removed). A word of warning I have slim wrists and I only have an inch left at the end of the strap to move the clasp down further. If you've got a large wrist I wouldn't buy this watch. Also it didn't arrive in the presentation box just on a cardboard holder in a plastic bag (with instructions and a warranty card, so may not suit for a gift. However, it's a simple watch that tells the time, that's all I was looking for and am happy with my purchase so far."
14,Manoj Kumar,"  Allora, prima di parlare del prodotto in se parlo  un po' della consegna e della confezioneConsegnaLa consegna Ã¨ stata tempestiva ed efficiente come al solito con gli ordini su Amazon il pacco Ã¨ stato recapitato da Bartolini con la solita professionalitÃ .ConfezioneL'orologio Ã¨ arrivato in una scatoletta di alluminio col coperchio in vetro, so che detto cosÃ¬ sembra davvero brutta ma non lo Ã¨ affatto anzi ha quel fascino minimale che va tanto di moda oggi.ProdottoC'Ã¨ davvero poco da dire su questo prodotto, Ã¨ il top,  bello, comodo, molto leggero e ci si scorda quasi di averlo al polso, sia elegante che casual un acquisto che mi ha davvero soddisfatto."
